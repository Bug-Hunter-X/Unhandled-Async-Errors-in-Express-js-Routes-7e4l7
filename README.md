# Unhandled Async Errors in Express.js
This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting to handle potential errors within asynchronous route handlers.  Failure to handle these errors can lead to silent failures, making debugging difficult. 

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `someAsyncOperation()` function simulates an asynchronous operation that might throw an error.  The `catch` block is present but empty, meaning errors are effectively swallowed.

The solution (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates proper error handling by logging the error and sending a suitable error response to the client.  This approach ensures that errors are properly managed and reported.
